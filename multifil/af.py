        A side note: This was where the attempt to write the model out in
        a functional manner broke down. I got this far with nothing ever
        asking another instance for any information and everything being
        passed by method parameters. This was a really nice idea and
        worked well until this point where I had to start performing
        overly complex mental calisthenics to understand how things were
        going to be passed around. This lead to the current system where
        each instance has an internal state that it is responsible for
        keeping. This might make debugging harder in the long run, but it
        made the model writable in the meanwhile. Some teeth gnashing is
        included below for reference.

        Teeth gnashing:
            The source of conflict here seems to be a competition between
            the desire to write this in a functional manner and have all
            information passed down to the function as is needed and the
            desire to be able to call any function of any module at any
            time and have it return something sensible. This makes
            testing some bits easier but means that it can become harder
            to track what is going on with the states of the various
            functions. I am unsure as to how this should be resolved at
            this time. I want the final design to be as uncluttered and
            easy to troubleshoot as is possible. Perhaps something where
            the storage of information is kept separate from the ways that
            the modules are acting upon it? The advantage of this is that
            passing information around becomes infinitely easier, the
            drawback is that I am not sure that this isn't just a step
            removed from declaring every variable to be global and making
            the whole thing a fair bit more brittle.

class ThinFilament:
    """Each thin filament is made up of two actin strands.  The overall
    filament length at rest is 1119 nm [Tanner2007].  Each strand
    hosts 45 actin binding sites (or nodes) giving the whole filament
    90 actin nodes, plus one at the Z-line for accounting.

    These nodes are located every 24.8 nm on each actin strand and are
    rotated by 120 degrees relative to the prior node [Tanner2007].
    This organization does not specify the relative offsets of the two
    filament's nodes.

    ## Naive repeating geometry of the thin filament
    The binding nodes of the two actin filaments must be offset by a
    multiple of the angle (120 degrees)x(distance offset/(24.8 nm)), but
    not by 360 degrees, or one of the actin filaments would have no binding
    sites facing a neighboring thick filament.  We assume that the actin
    nodes on the two strands are offset by half of the distance between
    adjacent nodes (12.4 nm) and 180 degrees.  This means that if one actin
    filament has a binding site facing one myosin filament, the second actin
    filament will have a binding site facing a second myosin filament
    12.4 nm down the thin filament.  The second myosin filament will be
    240 degrees clockwise of the first myosin filament around the
    thin filament.

    ## Binding site numbering
    As in the thick filament, the nodes/binding sites on the thin filament
    are numbered from low at the left to high on the right. Thus the 90th
    node is adjacent to the Z-line.

    ## Tropomyosin tracks
    While the filament is modeled as a one-start helix, as described in
    [Squire1981], chains of tropomyosin polymers follow the more gently
    curving two-start helix representation as seen in [Gunning2015].
    Assignment to tm chain a or b occurs with respect to the odd-even
    value of a monomer's index in the initial list of monomers.

        ================

        thick filaments. Each thin filament will link to either faces
        0, 2, and 4 or faces 1, 3, and 5.
        This will result in a set of unit vectors pointing from the
        thin filament to the thick faces that are either
        ((0, 1), (0.866, -0.5), (-0.866, -0.5))
        for the case on the left or, for the case on the right,
        ((-0.886, 0.5), (0.866, 0.5), (0, -1))
